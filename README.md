# SLAM Algorithms for mobile robots

This code includes kalman filter, extended kalman filter, unscented kalman filter, EKF/UKF localization with and without unknown landmarks and EKF SLAM implementation from the book "Thrun, S., et al. Probabilistic robotics." The data was gotten from a Turtlebot3 mobile robot in ROS/Gazebo I ran with teleop key and rosbag the data. The rosbag was converted to .csv.

To run: 
1. Navigate to the folder e.g cd 01\ -\ Kalman\ Filter/
2. Run: python <name of file> e.g python kalman_filter.py
